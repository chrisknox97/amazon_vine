# Big Data

## Overview of Analysis

### *Deliverable One*: To connect to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Instance before extracting, transforming and loading an Amazon Vine dataset into pgAdmin, creating four distinctly useful dataframes in the process. 

### *Deliverable Two*: To utilize the ``Vine_Table`` dataframe created in Deliverable One, filtering for ``helpful`` reviews and whether said reviews were part of the paid Amazon Vine program to determine whether paid reviews showcased bias compared to their unpaid counterparts. 

## Results

The Results of our analysis showed a disparity between reviews afilliated and unafiliated with the Amazon Vine Program. For this dataset, the vast majority of reviews were unafiliated with Amazon Vine. However, those affiliated with the program had a higher propensity to award a product a 5-Star Review compared to the overall 5-Star review percentage. 

### Vine Review Totals

* There were 94 reviews in the Amazon Vine Program. 
* There were 40,471 reviews unafiliated with the Amazon Vine Program.

### 5-Star Reviews

* There were 48 5-Star reviews in the Amazon Vine Program. 
* There were 15,663 5-Star reviews unafiliated with the Amazon Vine Program. 

### Percentage of 5-Star Reviews

* The percentage of 5-Star reviews in the Amazon Vine Program was aproximately 51 percent. 
* The percentage of 5-Star reviews unafiliated with the Amazaon Vine Program was approximately 39 percent. 
* The overall percentage of 5-Star reviews deemed 'helpful' was approximately 39 percent. 

## Summary

### Positivity Bias

The results suggest that there is positivity bias in the paid Amazon Vine program with approximately 51 percent of particpants awarding a 5-star review compared to only 39 percent of those unafiliated (a 12 percent difference). Additionally, the 39 percent of 5-star reviews from those unaffiliated with the Amazon Vine program aligns with our overall 5-star review percentage of 39 percent. 

### Sample Size

However, the issue of these results remains sample size as only 94 reviews analyzed were part of the Amazon Vine program compared to 40,471 reviews that remained unaffiated. That difference of nearly 40,000 reviews cannot be ignored as could attribute to the 12-percent difference in the respondent's 5-Star review percentages.
